## Description

An E-commerce website that will have reviews that can be edited and deleted(will help with full CRUD). It will include fake products that will just be there to fill the site. Will eventually be turned to a real shop for a friend of mine.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js
- Python
- Flask
- PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

The customer will be greeted a home page that includes summary of what is sold in the website. There will be an option to explore in the navigation bar that will take the customer to a different page that will show all the products currently being sold. The customer will also be able to create an account and add things to a cart that will be saved and can be looked at at another time. The customer will be able to add reviews to any product on the site and later can delete them or edit them.
